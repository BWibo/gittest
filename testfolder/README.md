## Documentation
Documentation is important, especially for public repositories. 
On GitHub it is strongly recommended to use Markdown (*.md) files for documentation. 
Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling all forms of writing on the GitHub platform. It is easy to learn and offers a rich set of features, like for instance code highlighting for lots of programming languages.

```java
// Here you can see some simple java code highlighted with markdown.
public void test() {
  int i = 0;
}
```

### Markdown GitHub integration
On GitHub the `README.md` file at the repository root, is shown on the github landing page of the repository (just like this file).
This is the place, where the most relevant information on a repository should be stored, as it is directly visible for all its visitors and contributors.

## Folder structure
How do we want to organize our repositories?

## Getting started using Git
Git is a version control system (VCS) for tracking changes in computer files and coordinating work on those files among multiple people. 
It is primarily used for software development, but it can be used to keep track of changes in any files. 
As a distributed revision control system it is aimed at speed, data integrity, and support for distributed, non-linear workflows.
Git was created by Linus Torvalds in 2005 for development of the Linux kernel, with other kernel developers contributing to its initial development.
As with most other distributed version control systems, and unlike most clientâ€“server systems, 
every Git directory on every computer is a full-fledged repository with complete history and full version tracking abilities, independent of network access or a central server. (from Wikipedia)
